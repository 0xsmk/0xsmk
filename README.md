# Hi, I'm 0xsmk

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on Security Engineering and Application Security Research.

Currently diving deep into secure development practices, vulnerability research, and building security tools that help developers write safer code. I enjoy understanding how vulnerabilities work at the code level and how to fix them.

My main areas of interest include:

- Security Development Lifecycle and DevSecOps practices
- Web application security (OWASP Top 10, API security)
- Vulnerability research and exploit development
- Building automation tools for security testing
- CTF challenges (HackTheBox, Duckerz, PortSwigger labs)
