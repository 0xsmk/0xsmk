# Hi, I'm 0xsmk

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in **penetration testing** and **Red Team operations**.  
Currently focusing on **Initial Access techniques**, CTF challenges, and developing tools that automate common pentesting tasks.  

My main areas of interest include:  
- Red Team methodologies and attack simulation  
- Exploit development and vulnerability research  
- Network and web application security  
- Capture the Flag competitions (picoCTF, HackTheBox, TryHackMe)  

I work mainly with **Python** for tooling and automation, and **C++** for low-level programming and reverse engineering.  
My environment of choice is **macOS/Linux**, where I build and test security projects.
